## Challenge: build a ToolTip

A `ToolTip` allows the user to hover their mouse cursor over a country to see information in a little pop-up box. Replace the `Dynamic` sentence with a `ToolTip` displaying information about the country. 

`ToolTip` takes two arguments: the object the cursor hovers over (the `Polygon`), and the information to be displayed to the user (the `If` statement with `Daytime` and `Nighttime` information).

You can use the same code for your `If` statement as before.

`ToolTip` needs to surround the `Polygon[x]` code you already have. `Polygon[x]` should be the first argument in `ToolTip`, and the second argument should be the `If` statement.
